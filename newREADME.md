# MPL LibStats

## Introduction

MPL LibStats is a simple web app build using Django/Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript that helps library staff record, track, and report references interactions with library patrons. This app is a basic clone of the LibAnswers module from SpringShare's LibApps cloud platform. The goal of this project was to create a similar yet simplier tool for use in a library setting. Because of the overall goal to make this project as simple as possible, the app lacks some of the detailed recording and reporting abilities present in other reference statictics collection software in exchange for meeting the specific and most important needs of my library. This project could be extended to meet future needs or the specific needs of other libraries. With some basic technical know-how, and the ability to follow online instruction, this app is simple and lightweight enough to deploy on a locally hosted server, like a Raspberry Pi, using a WSGI and Http proxy server like Gunicorn and Nginx.

## Functions

LibStats currently includes three basic fuctions:

- Recording reference interactions
- Viewing a log of previously recorded reference interactions
- Generating reports for recorded reference interactions
